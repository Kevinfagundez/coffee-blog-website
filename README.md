Dev Caf√© is an illustrative website designed to showcase my web development skills. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for form validation, with a responsive design and a coherent color palette. The code is clean and optimized, without relying on external frameworks, demonstrating my ability to work with fundamental web development technologies.
